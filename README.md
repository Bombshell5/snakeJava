# Overview

This is a java snake game, I'm try to learn Java so I followed multiple tutorials to create this game. I definetly learn more about Java and how it works. 
The gist of the game is a snake who eats to grow. You will lose if you touch the edges or touch yourself. Eat as many apples as you can.
